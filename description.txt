Always wanted to do a Spell Book only playthrough but failed because there weren't enough spell books in the game? Then this is the perfect mod for you!
 - Thanks to Jelo and Andreas for helping me with the sprites

More Spell Books adds 40+ new spell books and 45+ overall items!

Note: This mod is still in beta, but I worked very hard on it and would appreciate if you'd try it out! -BBackx
